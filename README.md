A Heart beat sync


## What is it
My idea is a smart watch where you can click a button,
and it will transfer the beat to the other persons watch 
and their watch will do the same. So you can feel your
sig-other's heartbeat whenever you are in need, or you are just feeling lonley.
I am thinking that this will use sms to do the trasnfer of data,
beause I want it to be long distance. No matter where you are,
as long as you are in range of a cell tower you should be able to do beatsync.
